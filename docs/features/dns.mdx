DNS is a service that translates domain names to IP addresses. DOM Cloud has DNS services available to all websites in all tiers when necessary.

## Switching to our DNS

If you host a website with a custom domain, you need to buy a domain somewhere. You can either buy the domain from us or from anywhere else, it doesn't matter.

Once you have owned the domain, you need to point the name server (in any registrar where you buy the domain) to these below:

```
nsp.domcloud.co
nss.domcloud.co
```

These are DOM Cloud servers (slaves) dedicated for resolving DNS values set from all (masters) of DNS records installed at our own servers. If you found any existing nameserver values before, please delete it and replace it with our sameservers above.

The nameserver change can take place between one hour to 24 hours depending on how soon you can flush DNS caches of your home routers or in your cable company. You can check if nameserver change has been 

After that, change the website's domain name in DOM Cloud's Portal (Select [Admin -> Change Domain](../intro/getting-started.mdx#managing-website)). Then, check your website connectivity in menu Check -> Check Connection. If it shown like an image below, then your set up is done correctly.

To add custom records to your domain, you can use the DNS Manager via Webmin -> DNS Records. You can also add or delete DNS records using [the deployment script](../deployment/deploy.mdx#dns).

:::warning

This method delegates your domain name server to our server. There could be some issues if you using this method e.g. If you already share some records with other services or your registrar have a strict policy about DNSSEC. In this case you're better [using CNAME/A+AAAA records instead](#directly-add-cname-or-aaaaa-record).

:::

## How it works

When you create a website with custom domain (other than `*.domcloud.dev`), a `dns` service is activated from [the deployment script](../deployment/deploy.mdx#dns), it's activated automatically by our Portal UI.

Any website where you buy a domain is called a registrar. We also sell domain, but you don't have to buy a domain from us, you just have to buy it from somewhere and set the nameserver to `nsp.domcloud.co` and `nss.domcloud.co`, which means that your domain DNS will be handled to us.

Usually changing a name server takes a hour to a day to propagate across internet.

## Directly add CNAME or A+AAAA record

If you don't want giving a whole DNS to us, for example because you only host a subdomain here or you want a to better DNS handles it for you (e.g. Cloudflare), then you can directly add CNAME or A+AAAA at your DNS provider.

Firstly, [go to Manage tab](../intro/getting-started.mdx#managing-website) at your website portal. At top left you'll find these information:

+ Hostname: **sga.domcloud.co**
+ IPv4: **68.183.191.223**
+ IPv6: **2400:6180:0:d1::770:4001**

:::info

Different server location provides different hostname and IP address!

:::

For example we'll hosting `sub.yourdomain.com` at DOM Cloud but using Cloudflare DNS, then in Cloudflare, add these records:

![](/assets/images/cloudflare-add.png)

`CNAME` is recommended instead of providing `A` and `AAAA` records, which directly giving an IP address. But it may be preferable to give `A` and `AAAA` records if you need to add e.g. root/apex domain.

:::warning

If you experience infinite redirects when using Cloudflare, disable its proxy <br/> (under `Proxy status`) OR turn off our SSL by run a new deployment with `features: ['ssl off']`

## Sharing A Domain

If you host a course or school/institutional and interested in using our platform for hosting student projects, your students (verified by using institutional emails to register an account) can be free of charge by using your existing institutional domain by setup these records. 

Let's say you want to share `*.sites.yourschool.edu` domain to your staffs and students that have access to emails under `@yourschool.edu` and `@student.yourschool.edu`. Then in your add these in your DNS:

1. CNAME or A+AAAA records for wildcard domain (`*.sites.yourschool.edu`) to one of our servers.
2. a TXT record for base domain (`sites.yourschool.edu`) with value `domcloud-authorized-email-domains=yourschool.edu,student.yourschool.edu` for additional security.

After that any account that uses `@student.yourschool.edu` or `@yourschool.edu` can register `*.sites.yourschool.edu` domains.

:::warning

Your students and staffs must register a Google/GitHub login that uses `@yourschool.edu` / `@student.yourschool.edu` or after adding and verifying a secondary email assosiated with that.

:::


:::danger

Absense of TXT record while adding a wildcard CNAME/A+AAAA records will make anyone can register under your domain for bad purposes without permission!

## Troubleshooting

DNS can be verified by using `nslookup` from your local terminal.

### Checking if DNS is working at server

First, make sure that DNS is enabled, to do that enter `nslookup <your-domain> <name-server>`, for example:

```txt title="$> nslookup sga.domcloud.co nsp.domcloud.co"
Server:		nsp.domcloud.co
Address:	68.183.191.223#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	sga.domcloud.co
Address: 68.183.191.223
```

If the second address matches with IP address shown from manage tab, then DNS is enabled correctly. Any nonexistent domain is either returning wrong IP address or just refusing to answer depending on your local ISP settings:

```txt title="$> nslookup nonexistantdomain.com nsp.domcloud.co"
Server:		nsp.domcloud.co
Address:	68.183.191.223#53

** server can't find nonexistantdomain.com: REFUSED
```

If that's the case then you need to enable DNS [via the deployment script](../deployment/deploy.mdx#dns).

### Checking if DNS is working at your end

Just type `nslookup <your-domain>` at your terminal and it will use your local DNS. For example:

```txt title="$> nslookup sga.domcloud.co"
Server:		1.1.1.1
Address:	1.1.1.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	sga.domcloud.co
Address: 68.183.191.223
```

In that case my device talks to [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1) to find that `sga.domcloud.co` points to `68.183.191.223`, which is a correct answer.

A non existing DNS server may simply refuse to answer, or if not, gives incorrect IP address.

```txt title="$> nslookup nonexistantdomain.com"
Server:		1.1.1.1
Address:	1.1.1.1#53

** server can't find nonexistantdomain.com: NXDOMAIN
```

If that's the case try double checking the NS entries in your registrar, or wait until all caches invalidates.

### Temporarily skip DNS at your end

You can skip configuring DNS altogether by directly adding an IP record to `/etc/hosts`:

```txt title="$> sudo nano /etc/hosts"
68.183.191.223 nonexistantdomain.com
```

This way your device will happily points `nonexistantdomain.com` to `68.183.191.223` without dealing with DNS servers. Save after editing and restart your browser.

Note that modifying `/etc/hosts` doesn't make the world care, at least your phone won't pickup that `/etc/hosts` you edited. This is why you have to buy a domain from a registrar.
