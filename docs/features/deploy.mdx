import ThemedImage from '@theme/ThemedImage';

The deployment system is the main feature in DOM Cloud. It let's you to perform automatic configuration all by convenience of a single script. It's also can be used as a CI (Continous Integration) tool that perform some tasks inside your website.

The deployment system is accessible through `Deploy` tab in the website menu. 

<ThemedImage

For common script deployments, there's existing recipes from [the deployment page](../deployment/index.mdx) or [recipe repository](https://github.com/domcloud/recipes).

We try to make it as simple as possible to understand. We also make our backend processing [open sourced](https://github.com/domcloud/bridge) so you take a better view of how it works if you want that.

The script runner is in YAML format. Here's a simple overview:

```yaml
source: # Source URL from internet to replace all files in "public_html"
features: # List of features to be enabled or configured or disabled
nginx:  # NGINX configuration to be set for current website
commands: # List of terminal commands that will be executed inside "public_html"
```

Each of these keys are explained in details below.

## `source`

Source URL from internet to replace all files in **~/public_html**. Common examples:

```yaml
# Clones octocat.github.io to  "~/public_html"
source: https://github.com/octocat/octocat.github.io
```

```yaml
# Download latest WordPress and extracts it from "wordpress" folder
source: 
  url: https://wordpress.org/latest.zip
  directory: wordpress
```

```yaml
# Removes all files and directories in "~/public_html"
source: clear
```

Type: `string` or `object`. If it a string, it will be the `url`.

If this value is set, it will download contents inside the host. The content can be either a ZIP file or a Git repository (to perform clone), or `clear` to simply clears the content.

:::tip

This option is useful if your files is already in a public repository such as GitHub. If you need to upload the files from your local device use [Webmin File Manager](./editor.mdx).

:::

:::danger

This option will always **overwrite** all contents inside the host. Use with caution!

:::

### `url`
The zip (or clone) URL to download. Required.

### `type`
To `extract` a ZIP file or `clone` a repo. If omitted, it autodetects whether it is a `github.com` or `gitlab.com` URL and perform `clone` instead of `extract`.

### `directory` (`type: extract` only)
Specify the folder name to move out of ZIP file after extraction. This also can be specified from `url`'s hash. If omitted, no move operation performed.

> For legacy reason, a `directory` in root config will works too, it will be converted as `source.directory`.

### `branch` (`type: clone` only)
Specify the clone branch to get checked out. This also can be specified from directory or `url`'s hash. If omitted, the default branch is checked out.

### `shallow` (`type: clone` only)
Do shallow clone? Default to `true`. It is recommended to leave it that way to keep `.git` internal size low.

### `submodules` (`type: clone` only)
Do Recursive clone of submodules? Default to `false`.

---

## `features`

Enable, configure or disable one or more features in the website. Common examples:

```yaml
# Enable MySQL and PostgreSQL
features:
- mysql
- postgresql
```

```yaml
# Install latest Node.js and Python in the server
features:
- node
- python
```

```yaml
# Ask for a new TLS certificate from let's encrypt
features:
- ssl
```


Type: Array of `string` or `object`. If one item is a string, it will be converted to object (.e.g. `mysql on` become `{ mysql: on }`).

This configures all features available for the host in DOM Cloud.

### `mysql`

Configure MariaDB (MySQL) Database Server.

+ `mysql` or `mysql on` Enable MariaDB and create default DB.
+ `mysql create <dbname>` Create a new database with `<username>_<dbname>`.
+ `mysql drop <dbname>` Drop a database with `<username>_<dbname>`.
+ `mysql off`. Disables `mysql` feature. **Caution: Also drop all DB permanently**.

### `postgresql`

Configure PostgreSQL Database Server.

+ `postgresql` or `postgresql on` Enable PostgreSQL and create default DB.
+ `postgresql create <dbname>` Create a new database with `<username>_<dbname>`.
+ `postgresql drop <dbname>` Drop a database with `<username>_<dbname>`.
+ `postgresql off`. Disables `postgresql` feature. **Caution: Also drop all DB permanently**.

### `dns`

Configure BIND DNS Server.

+ `dns` or `dns on` Enable DNS server.
+ `dns add <type> <value>` Add a record.
+ `dns rem <type> <value>` Deletes a record.
+ `dns off`. Disables `dns` feature. **Caution: Also clears all DNS records**.

You can add multiple records with lists. For example:

```yaml
features:
- dns:
  - add a sub-a 1.2.3.4
  - add aaaa sub-a 2001:1:2:3:4:5:6:7
  - add cname sub-b example.net.
  - add cname sub-c example.net.
```

DNS records for child server is handled automatically.

:::info

When applying CNAME, looks out for the trailing dot (`.`) at the end of CNAME values. 

It is required to specify the root domain, otherwise it will be appended with the parent domain.

:::


:::tip

DNS records is also configurable via [Webmin DNS](./editor.mdx).

:::

### `firewall`

Configure outgoing firewall in your domain. Only configurable for users with `Lite`, `Kit` and `Pro` plan.

+ `firewall on` or `firewall` Enable firewall (default for free users).
+ `firewall off` Disable firewall (default for subscribing users).

Firewall is an additional protection to make sure the host won't send any outgoing request not defined [in the whitelist](https://github.com/domcloud/bridge/blob/main/src/whitelist/sites.conf).

See the [relevant security description](../features/security.mdx) regarding this feature.

### `ssl`

Configure SSL or Attempt to renew SSL certificate with Let's Encrypt.

+ `ssl`, renew SSL certificate with shared domain (if available) or using Let's Encrypt if it not exists yet or starts to expire.
+ `ssl letsencrypt`, renew SSL certificate with Let's Encrypt forcibly.
+ `ssl selfsign`, renew SSL certificate with Self-signed certificate forcibly.
+ `ssl always` Always redirect HTTP to HTTPS
+ `ssl on` Enable both HTTP to HTTPS
+ `ssl off` Disable HTTPS access (not recommended)

### `http`

Configure HTTP version for HTTPS.

+ `http 1` use HTTP version 1
+ `http 2` use HTTP version 2

Using HTTP version 2 can be faster and beneficial on some websites.

### `root`

Set directory root path. This also changes the `root` directive in NGINX config.

:::info

`root` is configurable both in `features:` and `nginx:`. The following is equivalent:

```yaml
features:
- root: public_html/public
```

```yaml
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
```
:::

### `docker`

Configure Docker capability. Only for users with `Kit` and `Pro` plan.

+ `docker on` or `docker` Enable docker.
+ `docker off` Disable docker.

With this enabled it doing three things:

+ `usermod --add-subuids --add-subgids $USERNAME` to allow docker rootless using sub uids for assigning containers.
+ `loginctl enable-linger $USERNAME` to allow processes not get killed when SSH session terminates.
+ `dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install` to install docker daemon in user-scope.

The `docker` CLI is always available regardless of this settings as this is provided from a system-wide install packages.

### `php`

Set PHP (FastCGI) version. Available options:

+ `php 7.4`
+ `php 8.0`
+ `php 8.1`
+ `php 8.2`
+ `php 8.3`
+ `php latest` (default)

Remember that `php 8.x` is an active release. Changing this version also sets the `php` (and `composer`) to the right version in CLI/SSH. 

PHP files that served through NginX are served with `php-fpm` (FastCGI Process Manager).

You can't install custom PHP versions or any PHP modules since these are installed by RHEL system packages. However if you're expert enough you can install a PHP binary yourself then use Passenger Phusion GLS to run PHP by FastCGI. Read more on [how to deploy PHP websites](../deployment/php.mdx).

### `node`

Install specific NodeJS version. Available options:

+ `node` or `node latest`
+ `node lts`
+ `node beta`
+ `node x.y.z`
+ `node off`

By default it's Node 18.x provided from RHEL system packages. Note that the default system doesn't provide Corepack and supplemental package managers like yarn (berry version) or pnpm.

This also sets the `node` (and `npm`, `yarn`, etc.) to the right version in CLI/SSH and corepack will enabled. This installation is powered by [`webi`](https://webinstall.dev/node). All given node version is downloaded in binary/compiled version from [the official registry](https://nodejs.org/download/release) to keep switching version fast. Read more on [how to deploy Node apps](../deployment/node.mdx).


### `python`

Install specific Python version. Available options:

+ `python` or `python latest`
+ `python lts` or `python stable`
+ `python system`
+ `python x.y`
+ `python x.y.z`
+ `python off`

By default it's Python 3.9 provided from RHEL system packages, equivalent with `python system`.

This also sets the `python` (and `pip`) to the right version in CLI/SSH. This installation is powered by [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).

If you have problem creating virtual envs please using `pyenv virtualenv` or just use version `python system` which also works and always isolated for current user.

The difference with `python system` and `python off` is the latter will remove `pyenv` and all former local python installations.

The installer will try to download binary/compiled version from [community builds](https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone) if available to keep switching version fast. Read more on [how to deploy Python apps](../deployment/python.mdx).

### `ruby`

Install specific Ruby version. Available options:

+ `ruby` or `ruby latest`
+ `ruby lts` or `ruby stable`
+ `ruby x.y.z`
+ `ruby off`

By default it's Ruby 3.0 provided from RHEL system packages. All instalations with ruby gems has `--no-document` implied from global settings to keep installation minimal and fast. 

This installation is powered by [rvm](https://rvm.io). It will try to download compiled version from [RVM builds](https://rvm_io.global.ssl.fastly.net/binaries/centos/9/x86_64/) if available to keep switching version fast. Read more on [how to deploy Ruby apps](../deployment/ruby.mdx).

### `deno`

Install specific Deno version. Available options:

+ `deno` or `deno latest`
+ `deno beta`
+ `deno x.y.z`
+ `deno off`

There's no Deno installed in system-wide binaries. You must specify this feature to make it available.

This installation is powered by [`webi`](https://webinstall.dev/deno). Read more on [how to deploy Deno apps](../deployment/deno.mdx).

### `bun`

Install specific Bun.js version. Available options:

+ `bun` or `bun latest`
+ `bun x.y.z`
+ `bun off`

There's no Bun.js installed in system-wide binaries. You must specify this feature to make it available.

When configuring NGINX with `bun` you have to prefix it with `bunfix` which is installed by default.

This installation is powered by [`webi`](https://webinstall.dev/bun). Read more on [how to deploy Bun.js apps](../deployment/bun.mdx).

### `go`

Install specific Go version. Available options:

+ `go` or `go latest`
+ `go x.y.z`  
+ `go off`

There's no Go installed in system-wide binaries. You must specify this feature to make it available.

## `nginx`

Configures NGINX for a given website. Common examples:

```yaml
# Standard NGINX setup for PHP framework 
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  fastcgi: on
  locations:
  - match: /
    try_files: $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args
```

```yaml
# Standard NGINX setup for Node.js via GLS
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: on
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT node server.js
```

```yaml
# Standard NGINX setup for Python through WSGI
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: on
    python: .pyenv/shims/python
features:
  - python # This install python to .pyenv/shims/python
commands:
  - echo "from app import app as application" > passenger_wsgi.py    
```

All configurations below are not preserved at each config update. It's recommended to use the `NGINX` tab in the dashboard to reconfigure NGINX.

### `fastcgi`

Whether to enable or not enable PHP file execution: `on`, `always` or `off`. If omitted, `off` is the default.

:::tip

Read more about `fastcgi` option in [Deployment for PHP](../deployment/php.mdx#nginx-setup).

:::

### `error_pages`

List of error pages command. It's particularly useful for static websites. Read on [the NGINX docs](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#error_page).

+ `404 /404.html`: Show `404` error page as `404.html`.
+ `404 =200 /200.html`: Assume `404` error as 200 OK and show `200.html` (SPA).
+ `500 502 503 504 /50x.html`: Show `50x` error as `50x.html`.

### `passenger`

If you want to run Non-PHP apps, you need to setup with [Passenger Phusion](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/). Passenger is an additional layer on top of NGINX to run any non-PHP apps.

To enable non-PHP apps, at minimum you need these configuration:

```yaml
root: public_html/public
nginx:
  passenger:
    enabled: on
    app_start_command: node server.js --port=$PORT
```

The configuration above will execute `node server.js --port=$PORT` in the parent of root folder (in this case, `~/public_html`). Note that you always need to pass the `$PORT` and use that as the port where your app is listening to. If your app accept port from environment instead you can use env like `env PORT=$PORT node server.js`.

For custom environment values you can leverage `app_env` and `env_var_list`.

To restart a non-PHP apps you can execute `restart` in CLI/SSH. You can also make it [always restart](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/library/admin/apache/restart_app.html#restart-txt) if you have to.

Available options:

+ [`enabled`](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/references/config_reference/nginx/#passenger_enabled): `on` or `off` (default)
+ [`app_env`](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/references/config_reference/nginx/#passenger_app_env): environment setup. Either `production` (default) or `development`.
+ [`env_var_list`](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/references/config_reference/nginx/#passenger_env_var): array of environment values in the format of `KEY=VALUE`.
+ [`set_header_list`](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/references/config_reference/nginx/#passenger_set_header): array of header values in the format of `KEY=VALUE`.
+ [`app_start_command`](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/references/config_reference/nginx/#passenger_app_start_command): [Passenger GLS](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/advanced_guides/gls/) command to start the app with `$PORT` as the port where your app is listening to.
+ [`friendly_error_pages`](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/references/config_reference/nginx/#passenger_friendly_error_pages): `on` (default) or `off`
+ [`base_uri`](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/references/config_reference/nginx/#passenger_base_uri): base URL for the app (default is `/`).
+ [`document_root`](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/references/config_reference/nginx/#passenger_document_root): path to public document root (default is `root`). This value is relative to the user `$HOME` folder.
+ [`app_root`](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/references/config_reference/nginx/#passenger_app_root): path to app root (default is parent of `root`). This value is relative to the user `$HOME` folder.

For non-GLS (an alternative way if not using `app_start_command`) these options are available too:
+ [`app_type`](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/references/config_reference/nginx/#passenger_app_type): Type of App
+ [`startup_file`](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/references/config_reference/nginx/#passenger_startup_file): Startup filename
+ [`ruby`](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/references/config_reference/nginx/#passenger_ruby): Path to Ruby executable
+ [`nodejs`](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/references/config_reference/nginx/#passenger_nodejs): Path to Node.JS executable
+ [`python`](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/references/config_reference/nginx/#passenger_python): Path to Python executable
+ [`meteor_app_settings`](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/references/config_reference/nginx/#passenger_meteor_app_settings): Path to Meteor app settings

:::tip

Read more about `passenger` option for general app in [NGINX and App daemon](./nginx.mdx#configure-nginx-for-general-apps).

:::

### `locations`

Array objects which one or more of:

+ `match`: Matching URL location (required)
+ `root`: Root path (relative to `$HOME`)
+ `alias`: Alias path (relative to `$HOME`)
+ `rewrite`: Rewrite URL directive
+ `try_files`: Try files URL directive
+ `return`: Return code directive
+ `proxy_pass`: Proxy to local port or `unit`
+ `fastcgi`: (same as above)
+ `passenger`: (same as above)

Please read [NGINX Location directive](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location) for more information.

---

## `unit`

Type: `object`

NGINX Unit is a newer polyglot alternative to `passenger` features much simpler deployment system, logging and persistent instance across NGINX reload. The use of `unit` is much recommended albeit experimental.

NGINX Unit can bind to NGINX via `proxy_pass: unit` directive, then the app must listen to IPv4 localhost (127.0.0.1) and `$PORT` env much like how Passenger GLS works. This is the minimal settings to make it works:

```yaml
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  proxy_pass: unit
unit:
  # Bun.serve() always listen to $PORT
  app_start_command: bun .  
```

Available options:

+ `app_start_command` (required) a string command equivalent with how would you run the app in SSH/bash
+ `app_root` (optional) a string path of app working directory (defaults to `public_html`)
+ `env_var_list` (optional) array of header values in the format of `KEY=VALUE`


---


## `commands`

Type: array of `string`.

List of SSH commands in sequence. The starting directory is always `~/public_html`. If any exit code detected to be not zero, the execution chain stop.

This is where all the terminal commands written, for example to install depedencies, compiling binaries or injecting database credential.

The list of commands is always executed after the `source` and `features` and before `nginx`.

#### Builtin envar for commands

Aside with the usual SSH commands, it does have an additional envar to help with scripting:

+ `$USERNAME`: The username.
+ `$DATABASE`: The database name (usually `${USERNAME}_db` but can be changed if new database name is supplied before).
+ `$PASSWORD`: The user login password.
+ `$DOMAIN`: The domain name.

These envars also will be set:

+ `CI=true`
+ `CONTINUOUS_INTEGRATION=true`
+ `LANG=en_US.UTF-8`
+ `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8`
+ `PIP_PROGRESS_BAR=off`
+ `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$(id -u)`
+ `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/run/user/$(id -u)/bus`

These shell extras also be set:

+ `unset HISTFILE TERM`
+ `shopt -s dotglob`

#### Time limit

The time limit for overall script in single run is 15 minutes. If it's exceeded, the execution chain will automatically stop by signaling both `SIGTERM` and `SIGKILL`.

---

## `subdomains` and `subdomain`

`subdomains` is used to run specific commands for a given `subdomain` name. It's an array of objects with `subdomain`, some of the `features` and `commands` keys.

When `subdomains` are used, some definitions such as `source`, `nginx`, `features` and `commands` is adjusted to apply for a given subdomain name, including changing the root exection to `~/domains/<subdomain_name>/public_html` instead of `~/public_html`.
