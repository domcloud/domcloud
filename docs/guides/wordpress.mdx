## Recipe Features Explained

Let's breakdown the recipe to deploy a new WordPress site.

<details>
<summary> See Full Deployment Script </summary>

```yaml
source: https://wordpress.org/latest.zip#wordpress
features:
  - mysql
nginx:
  root: public_html
  fastcgi: "on"
  locations:
    - match: /
      try_files: $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args
    - match: ~ /xmlrpc\.php$
      deny: all
commands:
  - cp wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php
  - sed -i "s/database_name_here/${DATABASE}/g" wp-config.php
  - sed -i "s/username_here/${USERNAME}/g" wp-config.php
  - sed -i "s/password_here/${PASSWORD}/g" wp-config.php
  - sed -i "s/utf8/utf8mb4/g" wp-config.php
  - curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar
  - mkdir -p ~/.local/bin && mv wp-cli.phar ~/.local/bin/wp && chmod +x $_
```

```yaml
source: https://wordpress.org/latest.zip#wordpress
features:
  - mysql
```

This script extracts WordPress to `~/public_html` and sets up a new database.


```yaml
nginx:
  root: public_html
  fastcgi: "on"
  locations:
    - match: /
      try_files: $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args
    - match: ~ /xmlrpc\.php$
      deny: all
```

This script declare NGINX Configuration. It means three thing:

1. `fastcgi: "on"` means PHP processing is turned on.

2. `match: /` means for all requests, do `try_files: $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args`. It means try static files first then process root `/index.php` if nothing found.

3. `match: ~ /xmlrpc\.php$` means for requests to `xmlrpc.php`, do `deny: all`. This blocks the most common vector from DoS attack.

```yaml
commands:
  - cp wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php
  - sed -i "s/database_name_here/${DATABASE}/g" wp-config.php
  - sed -i "s/username_here/${USERNAME}/g" wp-config.php
  - sed -i "s/password_here/${PASSWORD}/g" wp-config.php
  - sed -i "s/utf8/utf8mb4/g" wp-config.php
```

This script auto configure the database connection for WordPress so you don't have to tell them during installation.

```yaml
commands:
  - curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar
  - mkdir -p ~/.local/bin && mv wp-cli.phar ~/.local/bin/wp && chmod +x $_
```

This installs [WP CLI](https://wp-cli.org/). WP CLI is a utility to perform maintenance tasks for WordPress using SSH commands.


## Using WP CLI

[WP-CLI Documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/). 
WP CLI is a convenient tool to manage WordPress without using the site. This can be accessed via SSH.

### Move Domain

If you want to change the domain of WordPress, you need to alter the links.

```bash
wp search-replace 'https://olddomain.net' 'https://newdomain.com'
```

### Reinstall WordPress

If you believe your WordPress core files is altered you need to reinstall it.

```bash
wp core download --skip-content --force
```

Reference: https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/core/download/

### Reset User Password

If you forget your admin password you can reset it. First, find your username with `wp user list` then reset it with `wp user reset-password`.

```bash
wp user list
wp user reset-password '<username>' --skip-email --show-password
```
