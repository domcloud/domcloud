Database is an integral part of any application. DOM Cloud provides a free, opt-in OS-Wide **MariaDB 10.11**, **PostgreSQL 17.4** and **Valkey 8.0** databases available for every website in every tier. 

## Initializing Databases

Databases are opt-in, disabled by default. To enable it, go to [deploy tab](../intro/getting-started#deploy-tab) and execute one of these:

```yml
features:
- mysql
```

```yml
features:
- postgresql
```

```yml
features:
- redis
```

See the section in [MariaDB](#mysql) or [PostgreSQL](#postgresql)  or [Valkey](#valkey) for more information.

To view and edit the database using online tools, use *PhpMyAdmin*, *PhpPgAdmin* or *PhpRedisAdmin*. All of them are available from [the manage tab](./editor.mdx).

## Managing Databases

You can manage databases in Setup -> Database. The entries below is the list of databases name that has been created.

<ThemedImage
    sources={{
        dark: "/assets/ss/database-b.png",
        light: "/assets/ss/database-w.png"
    }}
    alt=""
    className="img-fluid border rounded-3 shadow--md mb-4"
    width="700"
    height="500"
    loading="lazy"
/>

Note that you cannot create or drop database with PhpMyAdmin, PhpPgAdmin, phpRedisAdmin or with any external database client. You can only to do it either from here, the Webmin UI or in the [deployment script](../deployment/deploy.mdx#features).

## MariaDB

MariaDB is the fork of MySQL database. Here's how you connect it from the application in the server:

```ini
MARIADB_HOST=localhost
MARIADB_PORT=3306
MARIADB_NAME=<database name>
MARIADB_USER=<username login>
MARIADB_PASS=<password login>
```

The username and password login can be seen from [manage tab](../intro/getting-started#managing-website). The database name is tipically username + `_db` but you check the database name from [managing database](#managing-databases).

To connect the database with remote client, set the `MARIADB_HOST` as the server name, which also can be seen from manage tab. You can also use PhpMyAdmin or `mariadb` CLI from SSH to manage it.

:::caution

Username and password is always different from the default. Don't assume `root` username with empty password will work for you.

### Notable Differences of MariaDB and MySQL

Here's non exhaustive list of the differences:

- MariaDB have UUID while MySQL not. In Laravel 11, setting the database engine to `mariadb` will pick up the `UUID` as the native type for UUID.
- MariaDB doesn't support lateral join at this moment.

## PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is the most complete RDBMS. Here's how you connect it from the application in the server:

```ini
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_NAME=<database name>
POSTGRES_USER=<username login>
POSTGRES_PASS=<password login>
```

The username and password login can be seen from [manage tab](../intro/getting-started#managing-website). The database name is tipically username + `_db` but you check the database name from [managing database](#managing-databases).

To connect the database with remote client, set the `POSTGRES_HOST` as the server name, which also can be seen from manage tab. You can also use PhpPgAdmin or `psql` CLI from SSH to manage it.

### Supported PostgreSQL Extensions

These optional PostgreSQL extensions can be activated using `CREATE EXTENSION` clause on a given database:

## Valkey

Valkey is a fork of Redis. Here's how you connect it from the application in the server:

```ini
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_KEY_PREFIX=<database name>:
REDIS_USER=<database name>
REDIS_PASS=<database password>
```

The `REDIS_KEY_PREFIX` and `REDIS_USER` is the ACL rules that your application must follow, as the Redis server is shared for whole server. Get the `<database name>` and `<database password>` from [manage databases](#managing-databases).

Here's how to connect to Valkey for applications who do not support Redis ACL username and prefixed keys:

```ini
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6479
REDIS_PASS=<database name>:::<database password>
```

The port 6479 signifies that you're connecting to [ACL Proxy for Valkey](#acl-proxy-for-valkey).

We do not support remote connection to Redis at this moment. Please use PhpRedisAdmin or `valkey-cli` to manage it.

### Valkey ACL Rules

The Valkey instance set up at port `6379` is shared across the server. To protect user data, we set up an ACL authentication to each "database" instance. Given a "database" name is `user_db`, the [ACL rules](https://valkey.io/topics/acl/#acl-rules) applied are:

```
user_db on >${password} ~user_db:* &user_db:* sanitize-payload
  -@all +@connection +@read +@write +@scripting +@keyspace -KEYS
  +@transaction +@geo +@hash +@set +@sortedset +@bitmap +@pubsub
  +config|get +info +acl|whoami +acl|cat +acl|genpass
```

Most software or framework should work with this ACL rules, however not application would support key prefixing as implied in `~user_db:* &user_db:*`. To avoid code changes we recommend you to use port `6479` which is another daemon that can aid with automatic key prefixing to the master valkey instance.

### ACL Proxy for Valkey

DOM Cloud set up an [ACL proxy for valkey](https://github.com/domcloud/rdproxy) that listening on port `6479`. It's mirrorring connections to `6379` with these enhancements:

+ Automatically prefixes keys or read/write operations such as `SCAN`, `GET`, `SET` and so much more, to allow access any keys without having to prefix it with `user_db:` (where `user_db` is the ACL username).
+ Automatically removes prefix of `user_db:` with results from `SCAN` so the clients doesn't need to adjust with automatic key prefixing.
+ Support old `requirepass` login model with `username:::password` syntax in the password. This is meant for frameworks that doesn't handle Redis 6.0 ACL yet. 

Note that the proxy is experimental. Some modern features (like `HELLO 3`) won't work and some Lua scripting may not work if it written badly. See [the repository](https://github.com/domcloud/rdproxy) for details.

To connect to this proxy with `redis-cli`, use `redis-cli -u username_db:::password -p 6479`. PhpRedisAdmin is also configured to work on `6479` rather than directly with the master valkey instance at `6379`. Note that the `redis-cli` is a symlink to `valkey-cli`.

## Timestamp

Our server always sets the clock in `UTC`.

A good idea to handle timezone is done by client processing (Javascript), both after getting the data from database/AJAX and before sending data/Posts to server.

If you don't care about timezone and you think it's safe to assume that your website is only accessed in one timezone, you can set the timezone in the backend using [date_default_timezone_set](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.date-default-timezone-set.php) for PHP or [`TZ` env](https://medium.com/developer-rants/time-zones-in-node-js-fc5a5b51906a) for non-PHP (set it to passenger's `env_var_list`). 

## Other Database System

Only four database system is supported: `MariaDB`, `PostgreSQL`, `Valkey`, `SQLite`. For caching we recommend you to leverage Valkey or the filesystem.

You can also use third party databases that's also cheap (or even free) such as [Firebase Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore) or [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/cloud), just make sure the cluster is close enough within our server. 

If you wish to spin up a custom database server, you might be better deploy your website [using docker](../deployment/docker.mdx).
