Our server uses NGINX as Reverse Proxy for HTTP and HTTPS traffic and it is used to serve static files and proxy requests to your app. You need to configure NGINX to tell us how to run your website.

Because it operates in OS-wide config, only a limited set of NGINX features are configurable. The only way to configure it is via the [deployment system](./deploy.mdx#nginx). Fornatunely, we also give you a special page to make customizing it much easier.

If you never heard NGINX before, you can read some of good resorces here: 
+ [Official documentation](https://nginx.org/en/docs/)
+ [The NGINX Handbook](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-nginx-handbook/)
+ [Apache vs Nginx: Practical Considerations](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/apache-vs-nginx-practical-considerations)

You can either edit NGINX config directly or via our interactive form.

## Editing NGINX config directly

<ThemedImage
    sources={{
        dark: "/assets/ss/nginx-script-b.png",
        light: "/assets/ss/nginx-script-w.png"
    }}
    alt=""
    className="img-fluid border rounded-3 shadow--md mb-4"
    width="700"
    height="500"
    loading="lazy"
/>

The text area contains current NGINX script and you can freely edit it. When you click **Apply** it will convert your changes to deployment script like this:

```
nginx: |
  server {
    ....
  }
```

Behind the scene it will convert your input to YAML script represented in our [NGINX deployment script reference](./deploy.mdx#nginx) hence you won't be able to change certain protected values such as IP addresses, PHP proxy pass, etc.

:::info

You won't be able to edit root path via direct script. To change it, use YAML config. 

```yaml
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
```

Editing the root path this way will keep the rest config untouched.

## Editing NGINX config interactively


<ThemedImage
    sources={{
        dark: "/assets/ss/nginx-interactive-b.png",
        light: "/assets/ss/nginx-interactive-w.png"
    }}
    alt=""
    className="img-fluid border rounded-3 shadow--md mb-4"
    width="700"
    height="500"
    loading="lazy"
/>

The interactive NGINX config contains easy-to-read NGINX config that covers about 80% of usage for popular frameworks. When you click Apply it will convert your input to YAML script represented in our [NGINX deployment script reference](./deploy.mdx#nginx). The current setup shown represents auto-detected config of your choosing. 

Beware! Changing NGINX config this way may erases your customized NGINX config not represented using the form.

| Option | What is it? |
|---|---|
| Root Path | The directory where NGINX searches for static files before being forwarded to app |
| Cache Expiration | The static files [cache expiration settings](#static-file-caching) |
| Resolve Type | What is the kind of your app? |
| - Static | No app, just HTML files |
| - PHP-FPM | PHP [Handled by `fastcgi_pass`](#configure-nginx-for-php) |
| - Phusion App | Special handling for Node.js/Python/Ruby apps |
| - Generic App | [Any kind of app](#configure-nginx-for-generic-apps) (Traffic forwarded via `$PORT` arg/envar) |
| - Forward Port | Forward to hardcoded/docker/unit port via `proxy_pass` |
| - Deny Requests | Deny all requests (useful for subfolder config) |


The PHP-FPM mode has some useful preset

| Option | What is it? |
|---|---|
| - Smart | XAMPP-like webpages (hide `.php` extension) |
| - Root Index - Safe | Route all **extension-less** pages to `/index.php` |
| - Root Index - Standard | Route all pages to `/index.php` as `REQUEST_URI` |
| - Root Index - Always | Route all pages to `/index.php` as `PATH_INFO`  |

Please refer to [PHP deployment setup](../deployment/php.mdx) for each of security implication.

The Static mode also has some useful preset below and a way to configure custom `404` page.

| Option | What is it? |
|---|---|
| - Default | Nothing special |
| - Smart | Allow hiding `.html` extension |
| - Root Index | Route all pages to `/index.html` (Treats all as `200 OK`) |
| - Auto Index | Allow listing directory **and expose all file lists** |


## Editing NGINX Config via YAML Script


Below is the example of the configuration:

```yaml
nginx:
  fastcgi: 'on'
  root: public_html
  index: index.html index.php
  ssl: 'on'
```

Please see [NGINX deployment script reference](./deploy.mdx#nginx) for advanced configuration that we can offer.

## Configure NGINX for HTTPS

The [`ssl`](./deploy.mdx#ssl) option has three options: `always`, `on`, `off`. The `always` option will force the server to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS. The default value for `ssl` is `on`.

## Configure NGINX for PHP

The [`fastcgi`](./deploy.mdx#fastcgi) option has three options: `always`, `on`, `off`. The default value for `fastcgi` is `off`.

This section is covered more in the [PHP Deployment](../deployment/php.mdx#nginx-setup) section.

## Configure NGINX for Generic Apps

NGINX by its own only forwards connection and can't invoke the desired app to run. That's why we use [Phusion Passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/) so it can tell NGINX to invoke the app and forwards HTTP requests.

The minimum configuration to enable NGINX for Generic apps is:

```yaml
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: on
    app_start_command: npm start
```

... which is equivalent of running `npm start` before HTTP traffic gets forwarded. The app started in the parent of root
(`public_html/public`) by default to prevent leaking unintended files. The app started with `$PORT` envar set and this app is
[expected to serve HTTP requests at `PORT`](#port-environment-variable).

Passenger's `enabled: on` config is required to indicate that Passenger's module is activated for given host. It's required.

If the app must be called from another directory, you can use the `app_root` option to specify the directory that contains the app. For example, if the main app file is in `public_html/server/app.js`, you can set the `app_root` to `public_html/server`:

```yaml
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: on
    app_root: public_html/server
    app_start_command: node app.js
```

### PORT environment variable

The `PORT` environment variable is set by Phusion Passenger. It is a random port that's chosen as a HTTP proxy between your app and the internet. 

You can tell the app to listen to this port with another envar name using `env` like this:

```yaml
nginx:
  passenger:
    app_start_command: env HTTP_PORT=$PORT node app.js
```

Or you can set the port using the app's argument if available:

```yaml
nginx:
  passenger:
    app_start_command: node app.js --port $PORT
```

If you have designed your app to listen to `PORT` envar, leave it all alone:


```yaml
nginx:
  passenger:
    app_start_command: node app.js
```


:::warning

All examples here assume your app listen to IPv4 loopback (i.e. `127.0.0.1`), 
not IPv6 loopback such as `localhost` or `::1`. Passenger expects your app listening to IPv4 loopback port.

For example in Rust, you might have to specify it like `env TARGET=127.0.0.1:$PORT cargo run`.

:::


### Set Environment Variables

Passenger has three ways to set environment variables:

### `app_env` option

The [`app_env`](./deploy.mdx#passenger) option is special option that's used to set environment mode. The default value is `production`. This option sets the value to the following environment variables:

+ `RAILS_ENV`
+ `RACK_ENV`
+ `WSGI_ENV`
+ `NODE_ENV`
+ `PASSENGER_APP_ENV`

You can set this value other values such as `development` or `test`.

### `env_var_list` option

The [`env_var_list`](./deploy.mdx#passenger) option is used to set environment variables directly from NGINX. It's a list of environment variables to set. The value is a string that's in the format of `KEY=VALUE`. For example:

```yaml
nginx:
  passenger:
    enabled: on
    app_start_command: node app.js
    env_var_list:
      - APP_SECRET=SECRET_VALUE
      - APP_CONFIG={"key":"value"}
```

### `~/.bashrc` file

Passenger reads the `~/.bashrc` file to set environment variables. You can set environment variables in this way. For example run this command to edit the `~/.bashrc` file via SSH:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

Then add the following line to the file:

```bash
export APP_SECRET=SECRET_VALUE
```

The environment variable will be set when the app is started next time. 

More information about setting environment variables can be found in the [Passenger documentation](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/advanced_guides/in_depth/node/environment_variables.html).

### Restarting App

Any edits either in the app file or `~/.bashrc` file will not be applied until the app is restarted. You can restart the app forcibly by running `restart` in SSH, which will actually calls:

```bash
killall -u $USER
```

The alternative way to restart app can be found in the [Passenger documentation](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/tutorials/reloading_code/node/). Global NGINX Reload will also restart your app unless you're using [Proxfix NOHUP](#proxfix-nohup).

For some connection using Node CJS, Python WSGI or Ruby config.ru, you may need to restart by `passenger-config restart-app ~`. We have some reports restarting don't work with `restart` alone.

### Websocket

Websocket should works out of the box since only one app is spawned per website configuration. However, **The websocket disconnects if NGINX reloads** as of websocket sessions data lost in memory. To retain memory data after NGINX reload, use [Proxfix NOHUP](#proxfix-nohup)

### Proxfix NOHUP

`proxfix` NOHUP mode is a [custom made proxy app](https://github.com/domcloud/proxy-fix) designed to overcome Phusion limits during NGINX restarts. To setup `proxfix` NOHUP mode, prefix your app start command with `proxfix` with `NOHUP=1` envar like below: 

```yaml
nginx:
  passenger:
    enabled: on
    app_start_command: proxfix node app.js
    env_var_list:
      - NOHUP=1
```

`proxfix` will call `node app.js` outside from NGINX tree. So, when NGINX restarts, your app will not killed, it retains it's memory. NGINX simply calls `proxfix` who then proxies NGINX requests to your already-running app.

This has a downside that if you change NGINX properties, it will not be restarted -- You must call `restart` to really restart it. You also still need to consider if your app to recover even if it has restarted abruptly.

### Proxfix TARGET

`proxfix` can help to overcome phusion limitation where if your app `PORT` can't be customized.

```yaml
nginx:
  passenger:
    enabled: on
    app_start_command: proxfix node app.js
    env_var_list:
      - TARGET=127.x.x.x:2345
```

This will forward traffic to your backend at configured `TARGET`. 

### `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto`

Passenger will always add `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` to give the app client IP addresses and HTTP scheme. 

To determine client IP address or HTTP scheme reliably, you have to know how many layers of proxy needed to reach your site.

For example, this is the example of response headers from user IP `123.45.67.89` when there's no proxy via HTTPS.

```conf 
x-forwarded-for: 123.45.67.89
x-forwarded-proto: https
```

If the user is same but you're under a webproxy such as CloudFlare (assume IP 32:231::1), then it would be like this

```conf 
x-forwarded-for: 123.45.67.89, 32:231::1
x-forwarded-proto: https, http
```

The `X-Forwarded-Proto` is equally important to determine whether you should send a secure or plain cookies. This mean your app must be configured to trust proxy headers. Some framework may already do it, some other need be set explicitly.

## HTTP-3 and QUIC

To enable HTTP/3, turn the HTTP version to 3 in [the deployment system](./deploy.mdx)

```yaml
features:
- http 3
```

This enables many enhacements related to [HTTP 3](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/what-is-http3/) such as Multiplexing and QUIC protocol, resulting in much faster page performance especially on smartphones.

You tipically won't see HTTP 3 used after changing this since browser caches `Alt-Svc` for about 24 hours. To see the change, you need to open Incognito mode. After few refreshes, you'll see it will use `h3`. You can also check if HTTP3 working by using third party tools like https://http3check.net/.

What about HTTP/2? We do not support it due to how NGINX handles it ALPN algorithm. We can't individually either toggle it on or off at each site. Anyway, HTTP/2 suffers some major drawback that HTTP/1.1 can be seen faster in some cases.

## TLSv1.3

Our NGINX is configured to accept TLSv1.3 only, for stronger HTTPS security and lower TTFB (Time for first byte). TLS v1.3 is introduced in 2018, a 10 years gap from TLSv1.2 which introduced in 2008. TLSv1.3 sets minimum browser requirement to be fairly new, but we believe [95% browser coverage as of 2025](https://caniuse.com/tls1-3) should be no problem.

If you need to enable TLSv1.2 because of IE11 support or your webhook providers requires it, please use alternative proxy such as Cloudflare since we don't support TLSv1.2 at this moment.

## Static File Caching

Static file caching is enabled by default for media, CSS and JS files. This is done by sending [`Expires` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Expires) to the browser, so browser will cache your static files without checking it with any HTTP calls until the specified time.

The default the `Expires` header is set to 7 days. To disable it, set `expires` to `off`, like this:

```yaml
nginx:
  # .... the rest of nginx setting ....
  expires: off # default is '7d'
```

Note that this doesn't stop E-Tag header -- so when files unchanged, NGINX will send `304 Not Modified`. Also, you still need to force browser refreshing the CSS / JS files if that browser has visited your site with old `expires` setting.

To force browser refreshing the CSS / JS files, perform [a hard reload](https://superuser.com/a/512833). 

If a hard reload doesn't work for you and you're using a proxy service such as Cloudflare CDN Proxy, you have to [purge their cache](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/purge-cache/purge-everything/). Please purge only after setting the `expires` value to `off` so you don't have to repeat it later.

## Language-Specific Configuration

More information about configuring NGINX for specific languages can be found in the [Deployment](../deployment) section.

## Advanced Configuration

All other available options are specified in [Deployment System](./deploy.mdx) section.

## Global Configuration

Global configuration of NGINX cannot be changed. However, some of the configuration are set as optimally as possible. You can see more about the global configuration in [the file](https://github.com/domcloud/container/blob/master/preset.sh#L603-L612). Some of the interesting configuration are:

+ Static files are cached with `7d` expiration time [by default](#static-file-caching).
+ Gzip are enabled for many static files for size with >1000 bytes.
+ Maximum file upload size is set to 4GB.
+ There's [rate limit](https://www.nginx.com/blog/rate-limiting-nginx/) of 100 requests per second with 6000 burst request per server name to mitigate DoS attack.
+ [TLSv1.2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#History_and_development) is the minimum HTTPS version to support, which works for browsers as old as Windows 7 era (with IE 11), older browsers such as in Windows XP era will not be able to open your website.
