# Self-Hosting

Self hosting refers to providing your server (or VPS) and then connecting to our portal. Please read [the introduction guide](../intro/self-hosting.mdx) for more information. This documentation assumes you already have followed installation step in that guide.

## Installation Description

We've documented what software installed in your server in [domcloud/container](https://github.com/domcloud/container) GitHub repository:

+ [install-ubuntu.sh](https://github.com/domcloud/container/blob/master/install-ubuntu.sh) APT installs for Ubuntu
+ [install-rocky.sh](https://github.com/domcloud/container/blob/master/install-rocky.sh) DNF installs for Rocky
+ [preset.sh](https://github.com/domcloud/container/blob/master/preset.sh) Various config seeding
+ [genpass.sh](https://github.com/domcloud/container/blob/master/genpass.sh) Automated password rotation scripts

It's generally safe to rerun these scripts if you found any problem during installation.

## Using PSSH

If you have multiple servers, it's useful to use [`pssh`](https://www.cyberciti.biz/cloud-computing/how-to-use-pssh-parallel-ssh-program-on-linux-unix/) to run SSH commands in parallel.

```bash
pssh -t 0 -iPh ~/hosts "whoami"

pssh -t 0 -IiPh ~/hosts <<'EOF'
whoami
EOF

pssh -t 0 -IiPh ~/hosts <<'EOC'
cat <<'EOF' > /output/to/file
This is line 1
This is line 2
EOF
EOC

pssh -t 0 -iPh ~/hosts "su bridge -c 'cd ~/public_html; git pull' && sudo bash /home/bridge/public_html/src/whitelist/refresh.sh"
```

## DOM Cloud's Bridge Config

The [bridge software](https://github.com/domcloud/bridge) can be configured by editing `/home/bridge/public_html/.env`. Visit the GitHub repository to read their GitHub config.

```bash
SECRET="<your strong secret here>"
SSL_WILDCARDS=yoursite.com
NGINX_FREE_DOMAIN=
REDIS_URL=
ALLOW_IP=159.89.198.103,2400:6180:0:d0::e08:a001
```

The only required envar is `SECRET` and `REDIS_URL`. Both of them should already preseeded if `genpass.sh` script has been executed.

It's recommended to set Allow IP to `159.89.198.103,2400:6180:0:d0::e08:a001` which is our portal IP addresses to avoid brute force attack.

After any changes, restart bridge service with `sudo systemctl restart bridge`.

To update bridge service, run `su bridge -c 'cd ~/public_html; git pull'`. Beware with any minor version increment like `1.1` to `1.2` means there maybe some software change required.

## Firewall Config

We use `nftables` which is a more modern firewall than `iptables`. We generally encourages you to disable other firewall such as `iptables`, `firewalld` or `ufw`. The configuration is in:

+ `/etc/nftables.conf` - Main entry firewall, which should brings identical setup described in [Security Page](./security.mdx)
+ `/etc/nftables-docker.conf` - Docker specific firewall setup
+ `/etc/nftables-whitelist.conf` - Bridge's firewall whitelist IP list
+ `/etc/nftables-firewall.conf` - Bridge's firewall active user list

The firewall feature is disabled by default in self-hosting scripts. But if you wish to do so, run `sudo bash /home/bridge/public_html/src/whitelist/refresh.sh` to preseed `/etc/nftables-whitelist.conf` and `/etc/hosts` with IPs to be whitelisted in [the whitelist sites file](https://github.com/domcloud/bridge/blob/main/src/whitelist/sites.conf).
