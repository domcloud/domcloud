# Invitation Code

This page is about why and how we ended up using Invitation Codes for enjoying DOM Cloud Free Features, and how can you help protecting us from bots and deliver best security to our overall service.

## Why Invitation Codes?

When you enjoy our services there might be a time that you want to recommend this service to your friend or collegues, and enjoy our free service. You can generate an invitation code for them so they can join in.

Historically, we don't have any concept of invitation codes until so many free users usees our server, creating a new fresh website every seconds. That's also means our NGINX servers reloads every seconds and it's not good. That's even after we put many IP-based limitations.

We wish to not use this approach but at the moment this platform can't handle hundreds or thousands of signups every day.

Invitation codes can be generated by existing customers who is actively subscribing, can be reused according to specific limit or be re-created without limit.

## Where to Get Invitation Codes?

The order is:
1. Ask from someone who recommends you this service, if they have any.
2. Find one from [Discord Community Forum](https://discord.gg/ee6xre2q8W).

Invitation codes can be generated from any active subscribers (Lite or Above). Invitation codes found in forum commonly short lived up to 20 code per user (relevant parts below). 

We generate new one daily in the forum. Be understand that it's not just us who can generate one, anyone with active subscription can generate one. If all codes are expired in the forum, please wait, or just [upgrade](https://my.domcloud.co/user/upgrade).

[Go To Invite Code Generator](https://my.domcloud.co/user/invite-code/) if you've upgraded.

## Rewards for Sharing Invite Code

Anytime a new user registers with your invitation code, the total signups are incremented and you can see it in your dashboard.

When that user **upgrades**, you're rewarded with 1 credit  **once** per user. A credit is a virtual internet point that can be redeemed as a discount when renewing a plan that translates to:

| Plan | Full Price Monthly | Price per Credit | Total Credit Needed Monthly |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lite | $1.5 | $1.5 | 1 |
| Kit | $5 | $2.5 | 2 |
| Pro | $10 | $3.3 | 3 |
| Max | $20 | $4.0 | 5 |

This credit is not transferable, not refundable and can't be turned to real money.

## Sharing Invitation Code

This code is similar to a referral code. This is **NOT** an invitation code to join your team -- the person who uses your invitation code won't know anything about you. To create one, [Go To Invite Code Generator](https://my.domcloud.co/user/invite-code/).

Every code has a quota, you can choose either **20** or **2000**. With **20** or the small quota, only first 20 signups can use the code until you request a new quota on the next 12 hours (called as cooldown). Every request on a new quota generates a new code.


If you choose **2000** or the large quota, the next cooldown is 2 months. Be careful to not share the code publicly or risk quota depleted by bad actors. If the cooldown time is not over yet, you'll not be able to generate a new code.

With small quota, it's generally safe to put the code in public chat. However, be caution that when a bad actor get banned, the referred code will be instantly revoked. Repeated revocation will ban you from recreating another code. So, be caution when sharing it.

All quotas generally have 1 year expiration. The code still works even after you downgrading to free plan. However, you'll not be able to regenerate a new code until resubsribing.
