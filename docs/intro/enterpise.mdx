This page explains DOM Cloud enterpise service. This page introduces you about our "Enterprise" tiering.

DOM Cloud is run only by one person. This idea alone might be sound interesting you, especially if you think you gonna need to use this service a lot.

## Team Access / Self Hosting / Enterprise Service?

Before goes into the "enterprise" service, you need to understand our simple offering first.

### Team Access

The first is **Team Access**, available in [any subscription plans](./compare-plans.mdx). In a nutshell, it's a way to share admin access to your websites without giving your account password. It came with two kind access, a **member** which only grants non sudo access and **admin** which grants access to all administrative tasks except billing and payments.

Team Access is **great for web freelancers**. Say, you want create an account for your client website. You can upgrade their account and add your personal account there. That will allow you to manage your client website inside your personal account. No more keeping passwords!

### Self Hosted

The second is **Self Hosted**, available as a completely free service. Why it is free? Because you own the server, and you're the one in change to update and monitor it. 

Self-hosting is a great option for:

- Devops, who behind a corporate rule that mandates all data is self hosted to an on-premise server
- Developers, who finds our cloud services is not speedy enough or like to rent VPS elsewhere
- Hobbyst, who like a taste being sysadmins on their own gearbox or even raspis.

## Enterprise Service

The Enterprise Service means you wish to **fork DOM Cloud Portal (my.domcloud.co)** to your own need. 

**Why?**

- To provide similar PaaS with your own hand and generate revenue with it
- To managing a team or a company across many department and many servers
- You're retired DevOps or Sysadmin and wish to feel nostalgic

**Caveat:**

- The portal code is highly undocumented. Any request to customize it other than branding and that will be an additional fee.
- You must have your own VPS / On Premise Servers. And the portal is another VM.
- You ideally also need S3 keys, multiple domains, like for portal is `domcloud.co` and another one for public domains like `domcloud.dev`.
- Yes, I don't get paid for writing code for the portal, so I charge fee for that.

**Terms:**

- You must not use DOM Cloud branding name, site or logo.
  - may still use terms like "fork of DOM Cloud" or any term that doesn't make people think DOM Cloud is endorsing your brand.
- For legal reasons, the portal code license will be AGPL.
  - Yes you can sell the code again or put it in public I don't care but I will not be cooperate with you
- The installation and code fee will be a minimum of **1000 USD paid upfront**, large company may be more.
  - Includes up to 6 months access to source code and updates
  - Installation doesn't include OS Virtualization like Proxmox, I only accept root SSH access.
  - You need two servers, the main server and another small server for the portal
  - Custom payment and domain registrar integration can be discussed
  - Code updates and OS update can be discussed later
- After installation I will not touch your machine and forget your passwords
  - You still can ask me for couple things you don't know about being sysadmin
  - I don't provide actual support and I currently not interested in that
