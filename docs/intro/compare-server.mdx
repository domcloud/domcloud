DOM Cloud has many servers and they are different spec depends on capacity. All customers enjoy equal computing power no matter their current plan.

| Server Code (City, Country)  | vCPU | RAM | Disk | Backend | Has Docker |
|------------------------------|------|-----|------|---------|------------|
| SGA (Singapore)              | 1    | 2   | NVME | x64     | No         |
| WDC (Washington DC, US)      | 4    | 8   | NVME | x64     | Yes        |
| SGP (Singapore)              | 3    | 16  | NVME | arm64   | Yes        |
| MNZ (Manassas, Virginia, US) | 10   | 16  | NVME | arm64   | Yes        |
| NUE (Nuremberg, Germany)     | 6    | 8   | NVME | arm64   | Yes        |
| OSK (Osaka, Japan)           | 1    | 6   | NVME | arm64   | No         |
| SAO (Sao Paulo, Brazil)      | 1    | 6   | NVME | arm64   | No         |

To make sure no abuse and no slow down, we have many [security features](./security.mdx) in place.

The rule of thumb is pick closest with your targeted visitors. As more people came in and use any server, the server spec will get upgraded. This is also true for storage, which will be expanded or shink depending on usage on regular basis.

## ARM64 vs X64

ARM64 is a new architecture which is more efficient in power hence larger capacity in both vCPU and RAM. As we strive for offering most optimal pricing matrix, we recommend you to use ARM64 unless you have a specific reason to use X64 arch servers. 

The X64 servers are only offered for subscribing users to solve ARM64 compatibility issues. One of compatibility issues that you might get into such as when your apps need a linux binary or docker images which doesn't have ARM64 arch variant. The GitHub CI runner also doesn't offer ARM64 yet, which could be matter if you want to [compile your apps using GitHub CI](../features/github.mdx).

Beware when moving servers with different architecture -- like from MNZ to WDC, you need to reinstall all software
and depedencies since binaries would be different. 

## Docker Availability

Docker is generally not available on servers with one vCPU.
