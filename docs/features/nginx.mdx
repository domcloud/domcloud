Our server serves HTTP and HTTPS traffic using NGINX, it is used to serve static files and proxy requests to your app. 

Because it operates for all users on the server, only a limited set of features are configurable, the only way to configure it is via the [deployment system](./deploy.mdx#nginx).

If you don't familiar with NGINX, you can read some of good resorces here: 
+ [Official documentation](https://nginx.org/en/docs/)
+ [The NGINX Handbook](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-nginx-handbook/)

## Check current configuration

You can check the current configuration by going to Check -> NGINX.

<ThemedImage
    sources={{
        dark: "/assets/ss/check-nginx-b.png",
        light: "/assets/ss/check-nginx-w.png"
    }}
    alt=""
    className="img-fluid border rounded-3 shadow--md mb-4"
    width="700"
    height="500"
    loading="lazy"
/>

The left side is the configurable options, and the right side is the current configuration applied in NGINX. The configurable option is written in YAML format, which when saved, applied as a new configuration configured via [the runner](./deploy.mdx#nginx).

Below is the example of the configuration:

```yaml
nginx:
  fastcgi: 'on'
  root: public_html
  index: index.html index.php
  ssl: 'on'
```

## Configure NGINX for HTTPS

The [`ssl`](./deploy.mdx#ssl-1) option has three options: `always`, `on`, `off`. The `always` option will force the server to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS. The default value for `ssl` is `on`.

## Configure NGINX for PHP

The [`fastcgi`](./deploy.mdx#fastcgi) option has three options: `always`, `on`, `off`. The default value for `fastcgi` is `off`.

This section is covered more in the [PHP Deployment](../deployment/php.mdx#nginx-setup) section.

## Configure NGINX for General Apps

NGINX by default only forwards connection and can't invoke the desired app to run. We use [Phusion Passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/) so we can tell NGINX to invoke the app and forwards HTTP requests.

The minimum configuration to enable NGINX for general apps is:

```yaml
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: on
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT npm start
```

Which is equivalent to running `npm start` in the `public_html` (parent of root) directory, with the `PORT` environment variable set to the port that NGINX is listening to.

Passenger's `enabled: on` config is required to indicate that Passenger's module is activated for given host.

It is important that  `root` is set to the directory that contains the `public` directory. This is because NGINX will serve the `public` directory as the root directory for serving static files as you don't want to expose the entire app scripts to the public.

If the app must be called from a subdirectory, you can use the `app_root` option to specify the directory that contains the app. For example, if the main app file is in `public_html/server/app.js`, you can set the `app_root` to `public_html/server`:

```yaml
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: on
    app_root: public_html/server
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT node app.js
```

### PORT environment variable

The `$PORT` environment variable is set by Phusion Passenger. It is a random port that's chosen as a HTTP proxy between your app and the internet. 
**Your app must listen to `$PORT`** to be able receiving HTTP requests from NGINX.

You can tell the app to listen to this port by setting the an environment variable via `env` like this:

```yaml
nginx:
  passenger:
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT node app.js
```

Or you can set the port using the app's argument if available:

```yaml
nginx:
  passenger:
    app_start_command: node app.js --port $PORT
```

:::caution

Your app must listen to the port that's set dynamically in the `app_start_command` option. 
If you don't see a way to pass custom **`$PORT`** either via environment variables or app's argument,
then you might want to ask your app's or its framework's developer to make it possible.

:::info

If you make a social media app bot, you'll realize that the only way to make it work is **via a webhook**.
It's a limitation by design, as we're not allowing [any software running 24/7](../intro/guarantees.mdx#it-will-not-be-always-available) and running a background polling.

### Set Environment Variables

Passenger has three ways to set environment variables:

### `app_env` option

The [`app_env`](./deploy.mdx#passenger) option is special option that's used to set environment mode. The default value is `production`. This option sets the value to the following environment variables:

+ `RAILS_ENV`
+ `RACK_ENV`
+ `WSGI_ENV`
+ `NODE_ENV`
+ `PASSENGER_APP_ENV`

You can set this value other values such as `development` or `test`.

### `env_var_list` option

The [`env_var_list`](./deploy.mdx#passenger) option is used to set environment variables directly from NGINX. It's a list of environment variables to set. The value is a string that's in the format of `KEY=VALUE`. For example:

```yaml
nginx:
  passenger:
    enabled: on
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT node app.js
    env_var_list:
      - APP_SECRET=SECRET_VALUE
      - APP_CONFIG={"key":"value"}
```

### `~/.bashrc` file

Passenger reads the `~/.bashrc` file to set environment variables. You can set environment variables in this way. For example run this command to edit the `~/.bashrc` file via SSH:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

Then add the following line to the file:

```bash
export APP_SECRET=SECRET_VALUE
```

The environment variable will be set when the app is started next time. 

More information about setting environment variables can be found in the [Passenger documentation](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/advanced_guides/in_depth/node/environment_variables.html).

### Restarting App

Any edits either in the app file or `~/.bashrc` file will not be applied until the app is restarted. You can restart the app forcibly by running `restart` in SSH, which will actually calls:

```bash
passenger-config restart-app ~
```

More information about restarting app can be found in the [Passenger documentation](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/tutorials/reloading_code/node/).

### Websocket

If the app uses Websocket, you have to enable sticky sessions in NGINX. This is because there will be multiple process spawned and Phusion Passenger will load balance internet requests to many processes. If the requests are not "sticky", the Websocket connection will be lost.

```yaml
nginx:
  passenger:
    sticky_sessions: on
```

You can read more about sticky sessions at the [Passenger documentation](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/references/config_reference/nginx/#passenger_sticky_sessions)

:::caution

Server processes are often die, forked and respawned. **Never hold a global value in memory!** Use some kind of database (such as SQLite) when you want to handle one or more shared data such as websocket or authentication sessions.

## Language-Specific Configuration

More information about configuring NGINX for specific languages can be found in the [Deployment](../deployment) section.


## Advanced Configuration

All other available options are specified in [Deployment System](./deploy.mdx) section.


## Global Configuration

Global configuration of NGINX cannot be changed. However, some of the configuration are set as optimally as possible. You can see more about the global configuration in [this file](../integration/self-host#nginx). Some of the interesting configuration are:

+ Static files are cached with `max` expiration time.
+ Gzip are enabled for `css`, `js`, `svg` static files.
+ Maximum file upload size is set to 512MB.
+ There's [rate limit](https://www.nginx.com/blog/rate-limiting-nginx/) of 2 requests per second with 500 burst request per IP address to mitigate DoS attack.
+ [TLSv1.2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#History_and_development) is the minimum HTTPS version to support, which works for browsers as old as Windows 7 era (with IE 11), older browsers such as in Windows XP era will not be able to open your website.
