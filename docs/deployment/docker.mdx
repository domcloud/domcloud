# Deploy Docker Apps

:::warning

Using Docker requires [Kit Plan](../intro/compare-plans.mdx#kit-plan) or above.

:::

Docker in DOM Cloud is powered by [Docker rootless mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/). Enabling docker features is implicitly allows running 24/7 (doesn't have to actually using docker). Because of how powerful and resouce consuming this is only available starting with `Kit` plan.

> Docker is available only in [some servers](../intro/compare-server.mdx) as they offer the most computing resources we currently offer

When this feature enabled, these things applied:

+ assign `/etc/subuid` + `/etc/subgid` to allow docker using sub uids for assigning containers.
+ assign `/var/lib/systemd/linger` to allow backround processes not get killed when SSH session terminates.
+ registering `dockerd` as user-scoped systemd daemon by `dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh` and set it to run at startup.

## Getting Started

The deployment script below activates `docker` capabilities and set up a `docker-compose.yml` file from `services` script.

```yaml title=https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/docker.yml
# Requires Kit plan or higher!
source: clear
features:
  - docker
services:
  hello_world:
    # https://github.com/cernoel/docker-hello-world
    image: cernoel/hello-world:main
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 8080:8000
```

The `services` subpath is equal to `services` declared in docker compose file. In fact, you can simply copy paste any docker compose file from internet to our deployment script! The port mapping will be linked automatically to our NGINX system. After deployment, you can examine the final `docker-compose.yml` in the `~/public_html`:

```yaml title="cat ~/public_html/docker-compose.yml"
services:
  hello_world:
    image: cernoel/hello-world:main
    restart: always
    ports:
      - target: 8000
        host_ip: 127.151.60.204
        protocol: tcp
        published: "8080"
```

`docker compose down` and `docker compose up` will be automatically everytime a deployment script is called with `services:` prop. Note that you **cannot** declare `volumes:` and `networks:` using deployment script. See [With Existing Docker Compose](#with-existing-docker-compose) for solution. 

### *What? why `host_ip` is `127.x.x.x`?* 

DOM Cloud is a shared hosting environment. To avoid clashing with other users your web instance will be assigned one IP in loopback port `127.0.0.0/8` randomly. The IP will be persisted and `proxy_pass` will be configured automatically. 

```yaml title="nginx.conf"
server {
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.151.60.204:8080;
    }
}
```

How does it know if port `8080` is the web gateway? Because we designed it that way. **You can only put one `ports` entry in the whole compose script** and it's only for your web gateway. **Do not expose any other port even if it's for easy database access**. Only access your internal container data via `docker exec`. 

### With Existing Docker Compose

What if you already have `docker-compose.yml` file, perhaps from a GitHub repo?

The example below setup [Plausible self-hosting](https://github.com/plausible/hosting) with their depedencies.

```yaml title=https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/docker.yml
source: https://github.com/plausible/hosting
features: docker
services: docker-compose.yml # docker compose always ran after commands
commands:
  - echo BASE_URL=https://$DOMAIN > plausible-conf.env
  - echo SECRET_KEY_BASE=$(openssl rand -base64 48) >> plausible-conf.env
  - echo TOTP_VAULT_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32) >> plausible-conf.env
```

You can configure your containers using `docker` commands in SSH. To reconfigure composer file cleanly just like running `services:` via deployment script without leaving SSH you can run:

```
docker compose -f ~/public_html/docker-compose.yml down --remove-orphans
docker compose -f ~/public_html/docker-compose.yml up --build --detach
```

## Healthcheck

While your app and it services runs 24/7, sometimes your app can crash on itself. Use `proxfix` NOHUP mode to watch docker on every request. 

```yarn

```

Then run `docker compose up -d` again.

## Managing systemd daemon

Your docker instance is registered as user-scoped systemd service. You can call these systemd commands to diagnose docker problems

+ `systemctl status docker --user`
+ `systemctl start docker --user`

## Custom systemd daemon
