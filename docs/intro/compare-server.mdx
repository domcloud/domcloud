DOM Cloud has many servers and they are different spec depends on capacity. All customers enjoy equal computing power no matter their current plan.

| Server Code (City, Country) | vCPU   | RAM     | Disk | Backend | Has Docker | Min TLS     | Max App Mem |
|-----------------------------|--------|---------|------|---------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| SGX (Singapore)             | 2      | **14G** | NVME | **x64** | **Yes**    | **TLSv1.2** | **128MB**   |
| WDC (Washington DC, US)     | **4**  | 8G      | NVME | **x64** | **Yes**    | **TLSv1.2** | **128MB**   |
| SGP (Singapore)             | **3**  | **16G** | NVME | arm64   | **Yes**    | TLSv1.3     | 32MB        |
| MNZ (Virginia, US)          | **10** | **16G** | NVME | arm64   | **Yes**    | TLSv1.3     | 32MB        |
| NUE (Nuremberg, Germany)    | **6**  | 8G      | NVME | arm64   | **Yes**    | **TLSv1.2** | **64MB**    |
| OSK (Osaka, Japan)          | 1      | 6G      | NVME | arm64   | No         | **TLSv1.2** | **64MB**    |
| SAO (Sao Paulo, Brazil)     | 1      | 6G      | NVME | arm64   | No         | **TLSv1.2** | **64MB**    |

The rule of thumb is pick closest with your targeted visitors if requirement for the website is fit. As more people came in and use any server, the server spec will get upgraded. This is also true for storage, which will be expanded or shink depending on usage on regular basis.

## ARM64 vs X64

ARM64 is a new architecture which is more efficient in power hence larger capacity in both vCPU and RAM. As we strive for offering most optimal pricing matrix, we recommend you to use ARM64 unless you have a specific reason to use X64 arch servers. 

The X64 servers are only offered for subscribing users to solve ARM64 compatibility issues. One of compatibility issues that you might get into such as when your apps need a linux binary or docker images which doesn't have ARM64 arch variant. The GitHub CI runner also doesn't offer ARM64 yet, which could be matter if you want to [compile your apps using GitHub CI](../features/github.mdx).

Beware when moving servers with different architecture -- like from MNZ to WDC, you need to reinstall all software
and depedencies since binaries would be different. 

## Minimum TLS Version

The minimum TLS version for x64 servers is set to TLSv1.2 for wider TLS compatibility for subscribing users. If your system is tied with older systems that doesn't support TLSv1.3 you may need to move to server supporting TLSv1.2.

Regular servers has TLSv1.3 as minimum TLS version for lesser handshake operation. This applies server wide and can't be customized per website.

## Docker Availability

Docker is generally not available on servers with one vCPU. Enabling Docker feature will remove max app memory limit restriction.

## Database and Cache Availability

All servers support MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Valkey and Opcache. The valkey `maxmemory` and opcache `opcache.memory_consumption` is capped at 256MB or 15% of memory, whichever is higher.
