title: Database Providers

Database is an integral part of any application. DOM Cloud provides a free, opt-in OS-Wide **MariaDB 10.11** and **PostgreSQL 16.4** database instance for every website in every tier. 

### Initializing the Database

Databases is opt-in, disabled by default. To enable it, go to [deploy tab](../intro/getting-started#deploy-tab) and execute one of these:

```yml
features:
- mysql
```

```yml
features:
- postgresql
```

```yml
features:
- redis
```

See the section in [MariaDB](../deployment/deploy.mdx#mysql) or [PostgreSQL](../deployment/deploy.mdx#postgresql)  or [Valkey](../deployment/deploy.mdx#valkey) for more information.

To view and edit the database using online tools, use *PhpMyAdmin*, *PhpPgAdmin* or *PhpRdAdmin*. All of them are available from [the manage tab](./editor.mdx).

:::info

You can't create or drop database from PhpMyAdmin, PhpPgAdmin or any external database client. You have to do that from Webmin UI or [deployment script](../deployment/deploy.mdx#features).

Our valkey instance is shared across the server with ACL and managed outside webmin interface. Read more below.

:::

### Using the Database

After activating the database, you can provide the database credentials to your app. This is one for RDBMS (MariaDB/PostgreSQL):

+ Hostname: `localhost` (because the database always live in the same server)
+ Port: `3306` for MariaDB, `5432` for PostgreSQL
+ Username: Same username with server (see from [manage tab](../intro/getting-started#managing-website))
+ Password: Same password with server (see from [manage tab](../intro/getting-started#managing-website))
+ Database name: Usually username with suffix + `_db` unless you've created another DB
  - For example with username `hello-world` then database name will be `hello_world_db`
  - Check the correct database name from PhpMyAdmin or PhpPgAdmin

While this one is for connecting to Valkey:

+ Hostname: `localhost` (because the database always live in the same server)
+ Port: `6379` for Valkey or `6479` for the [ACL Proxy](#acl-proxy-for-valkey)
+ Username: The ACL username coming from the database tab.
+ Password: The ACL password coming from the database tab.

:::caution

Username and password is always different from the default. Don't assume `root` username with empty password will work for you.

:::

### Remote Access

Remote Access is used to manage databases using your local software -- such as DBeaver, HeidiSQL or TablePlus.

PostgreSQL and MariaDB permits remote access by default, while Valkey don't.

:::info

When connecting with Remote Access, the hostname is your website domain or the server's IP address, not `localhost`.

:::

### Valkey ACL Rules

The Valkey instance set up at port `6379` is shared across the server. To protect user data, we set up an ACL authentication to each "database" instance. Given a "database" name is `user_db`, the [ACL rules](https://valkey.io/topics/acl/#acl-rules) applied are:

```
user_db on >${password} ~user_db:* &user_db:* sanitize-payload
  -@all +@connection +@read +@write +@scripting +@keyspace -KEYS
  +@transaction +@geo +@hash +@set +@sortedset +@bitmap +@pubsub
  +config|get +info +acl|whoami +acl|cat +acl|genpass
```

Most software or framework should work with this ACL rules, however not application would support key prefixing as implied in `~user_db:* &user_db:*`. To avoid code changes we recommend you to use port `6479` which is another daemon that can aid with automatic key prefixing to the master valkey instance.

### ACL Proxy for Valkey

DOM Cloud set up an [ACL proxy for valkey](https://github.com/domcloud/rdproxy) that listening on port `6479`. It's mirrorring connections to `6379` with these enhancements:

+ Automatically prefixes keys or read/write operations such as `SCAN`, `GET`, `SET` and so much more, to allow access any keys without having to prefix it with `user_db:` (where `user_db` is the ACL username).
+ Automatically removes prefix of `user_db:` with results from `SCAN` so the clients doesn't need to adjust with automatic key prefixing.
+ Support old `requirepass` login model with `username:::password` syntax in the password. This is meant for frameworks that doesn't handle Redis 6.0 ACL yet. 

Note that the proxy is experimental. Some features (like `HELLO 3`) won't work. See [the repository](https://github.com/domcloud/rdproxy) for details.

To connect to this proxy with `redis-cli`, use `redis-cli -u username_db:::password -p 6479`. PhpRdAdmin is also configured to work on `6479` rather than directly with the master valkey instance at `6379`.

### Timestamp

Our server always sets the clock in `UTC`.

A good idea to handle timezone is done by client processing (Javascript), both after getting the data from database/AJAX and before sending data/Posts to server.

If you don't care about timezone and you think it's safe to assume that your website is only accessed in one timezone, you can set the timezone in the backend using [date_default_timezone_set](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.date-default-timezone-set.php) for PHP or [`TZ` env](https://medium.com/developer-rants/time-zones-in-node-js-fc5a5b51906a) for non-PHP (set it to passenger's `env_var_list`). 

### Supported PostgreSQL Extensions

These optional PostgreSQL extensions can be activated using `CREATE EXTENSION` clause on a given database:

### Other Database System

Only four database system is supported: `MariaDB`, `PostgreSQL`, `Valkey`, `SQLite`. For caching we recommend you to leverage Valkey or the filesystem.

You can also use third party databases that's also cheap (or even free) such as [Firebase Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore) or [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/cloud), just make sure the cluster is close enough within our server. 

If you wish to spin up a custom database server, you might be better deploy your website [using docker](../deployment/docker.mdx).
