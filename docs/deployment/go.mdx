# Deploy Go Apps

[Go](https://go.dev) is a popular programming language for backend development. Go is served as a compiled language, which means you need to compile your code before running it. 

There is no default `go` compiler at system level. You have to install it first through deployment scripts.

:::warning

Serving Go apps requires to be run via GLS, that's mean you have to listen from given `PORT` env/args.

:::

## Example

The deployment script below installs the latest `go` compiler and compiles `main.go` and serves that `main` binary. 

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/go.yml"
source: clear
features:
  - go
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT ./main
commands:
  - filename: main.go
    content: |
      package main

      import (
        "fmt"
        "net/http"
        "os"
        "runtime"
        "strings"
      )

      const html_text = `
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
      <head>
        <title>Go App</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="//unpkg.com/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">
      </head>
      <body class="p-5 text-center">
        <p><img src="//images.unsplash.com/photo-1465153690352-10c1b29577f8?fit=crop&w=200&h=200" 
            class="img-fluid rounded-circle"></p>
        <h1 class="mb-3">Hello, world!</h1>
        <p>Serving from Go version %s</p>
        <p class="text-muted">DOM Cloud</p>
      </body>
      </html>
      `

      func home(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
        w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/html")
        version := strings.Replace(runtime.Version(), "go", "", 1)
        fmt.Fprintf(w, html_text, version)
      }

      func main() {
        http.HandleFunc("/", home)
        port := os.Getenv("PORT")
        if port == "" {
          fmt.Print("PORT environment variable not set")
          os.Exit(1)
        }
        http.ListenAndServe("127.0.0.1:"+port, nil)
      }

  - go build main.go
```

For existing golang apps, use this deployment script. This project must have a `go.mod` initialized and has package name as `main`.

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/go-binary.yml"
features:
  - go
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT ./app
commands:
  - go mod download
  - go build -o app
```

It's possible to run the app via `go run .`. This eliminates the need to compile the binary, although startup time may be a little bit slower.

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/go-gls.yml"
features:
  - go
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT go run .
commands:
  - go mod download
```

## Use other Go versions

To switch golang version use feature syntax like `go stable`, `go beta`, `go 1.19`, etc. Check your current go version using `go version` in SSH.

```yaml
features:
  - go 1.19
```

Go install scripts is powered by [webi](https://webinstall.dev/golang/). 

## App Management

Your app do not restarted automatically after file changes. To restart, run `restart` via SSH.

Environment variables can be set either using NGINX's `env_var_list` or `~/.bashrc`. Usually your language framework also reads `.env` files.

See [NGINX and App Daemon](../features/nginx.mdx) for more information about NGINX and App managements including restarting, environment variables, and other global limitations.

## App Logging

We do not have built-in logging capability at this time. Only startup problems displayed in the browser.

Please use a proper logging mechanism such as [the standard logging library](https://pkg.go.dev/log) then write it to a log file, or any other solution that suits you.

NGINX errors and traffic logs can be examined via Webmin.
