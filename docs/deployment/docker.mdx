# Deploy Docker Apps

:::warning

Using Docker requires [Kit Plan](../intro/compare-plans.mdx#kit-plan) or above.

:::

Docker in DOM Cloud is powered by [Docker rootless mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/). Enabling docker features is implicitly allows running 24/7 (doesn't have to actually using docker). Because of how powerful and resouce consuming this is only available starting with `Kit` plan.

> Docker is available only in [some servers](../intro/compare-server.mdx) as they offer the most computing resources we currently offer.

When this feature enabled, these things applied:

+ assign `/etc/subuid` + `/etc/subgid` to allow docker using sub uids for assigning containers.
+ assign `/var/lib/systemd/linger` to allow backround processes not get killed when SSH session terminates.
+ registering `dockerd` as user-scoped systemd daemon by `dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh` and set it to run at startup.

Because Docker run as daemon, the feature also allows any app under the site have a long running processes i.e. the [3 hour process limit](../features/security.mdx#dom-cloud-bridges-sudokill) is automatically appealed no matter if it actually uses Docker or not.

Enable docker with writing this to the [deployment script](./deploy.mdx):

```yaml
features:
- docker
```

## Getting Started

The deployment script below activates `docker` capabilities and set up a `docker-compose.yml` file from `services` script.

```yaml title=https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/docker.yml
# Requires Kit plan or higher!
source: clear
features:
  - docker
services:
  hello_world:
    # https://github.com/cernoel/docker-hello-world
    image: cernoel/hello-world:main
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 8080:8000
```

The `services` subpath is equal to `services` declared in docker compose file. In fact, you can simply copy paste any docker compose file from internet to our deployment script! The port mapping will be linked automatically to our NGINX system. After deployment, you can examine the final `docker-compose.yml` in the `~/public_html`:

```yaml title="cat ~/public_html/docker-compose.yml"
services:
  hello_world:
    image: cernoel/hello-world:main
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 12345:8000/tcp
```

The host port has been changed to ensure it's only assigned to your website. The port range chosen is between `10000` to `30000`, which is a port range that blocked from outside. If you already set the port range `>32000` the port chosen will be left unchanged to allow you expose that to the greater internet.

When calling `services` in deployment system, `docker compose down` and `docker compose up` will be automatically everytime a deployment script is called with `services:` prop. Note that you **cannot** declare `volumes:` and `networks:` using deployment script. See [With Existing Docker Compose](#with-existing-docker-compose) for solution. 


How does it know if port `8080` is the web gateway? Because we're guessing. To enforce which port forwarded by NGINX, use 

### With Existing Docker Compose

What if you already have `docker-compose.yml` file, perhaps from a GitHub repo?

The example below setup [Plausible self-hosting](https://github.com/plausible/hosting) with their depedencies.

```yaml title=https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/docker.yml
source: https://github.com/plausible/hosting
features: docker
services: docker-compose.yml # docker compose always ran after commands
commands:
  - echo BASE_URL=https://$DOMAIN > plausible-conf.env
  - echo SECRET_KEY_BASE=$(openssl rand -base64 48) >> plausible-conf.env
  - echo TOTP_VAULT_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32) >> plausible-conf.env
```

You can configure your containers using `docker` commands in SSH. To reconfigure composer file cleanly just like running `services:` via deployment script without leaving SSH you can run:

```sh
docker compose -f ~/public_html/docker-compose.yml down --remove-orphans
docker compose -f ~/public_html/docker-compose.yml up --build --detach
```

## Healthcheck

While your app and it services runs 24/7, sometimes your app can crash on itself. Use [`proxfix` NOHUP mode](./nginx.mdx#proxfix-nohup) to watch docker on every request. 

```yaml
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: on
    app_start_command: proxfix docker compose up --force-recreate -d
    env_var_list:
    - NOHUP=1
    - TARGET=127.0.0.0:8080
```

The proxfix process spawns and check if `TARGET=127.0.0.0:8080` still running. If it not, it will spawn `docker compose up --force-recreate -d` and forwarding requests to `TARGET` address, which is should be where docker listening to. To know the correct `TARGET` value, check to your `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Connecting with Host Services

If you want to use host services such as our MariaDB / PostgreSQL / Valkey database, you can use `10.0.2.2` as the IP for connecting host inside container. Do not use `host.docker.internal` as [it's not working](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/47684) for rootless Docker.

Using our shared database has a benefit of faster disk speed and be included to our daily backup.

## Playing Docker with SSH

You can also play with Docker directly using SSH with `docker run -ti --rm ubuntu /bin/bash`. It will create a root Ubuntu shell that you can play with. To make your changes persistent, please consider writing a `Dockerfile` or explore existing container images with Docker Hub.

## Managing containers

All docker commands is available as usual. To make managing a bit easier, DOM Cloud also installed [lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker), a TUI for managing docker available via SSH.

## Managing systemd daemon

Your docker instance is registered as user-scoped systemd service. You can call these systemd commands to diagnose docker problems

+ `systemctl status docker --user`
+ `systemctl start docker --user`

You can also install or uninstall docker engine via SSH by running below.

+ `dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install --skip-iptables`
+ `dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh uninstall --skip-iptables`

## Troubleshooting

### 502 Bad Gateway

This could means your docker container is unable to run. Please check `docker ps`, `docker logs`, `systemctl status docker --user`.

If it running normally, please check if NGINX and docker compose running the same proxy_pass. Try deploying `service: docker-compose.yml` again. 

If the docker stopped in SystemD, try enable it `systemctl start docker --user`, or try run `dockerd-rootless.sh` in SSH to see if any problem related to the daemon.

### `exec format error` in docker logs

This means the container is not available in system architecture. Our servers can be an `arm64` (ARM) not `amd64` (Intel), not every image containers have this platform arch. Check it with Docker Hub.

If you confirm that the image containers is `amd64` only, please move the server to x64 variant, that's SGA/WDC server -- or build your own image.

### Network Slow / Not Working

We use [`pasta` driver](https://passt.top) for rootless networking which is fast for incoming connections to the container but not for outgoing networks. If you experience frequent network errors during docker build please add `--network=host` to the docker build args or below for compose file:

```yml
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      network: host
```

Diagnose network by running `dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh nsenter`. This will put you into a shell environment inside RootlessKit namespace.

### Can't Choose Host IP to forward

If you set port forwarding such as `127.1.2.3:8080:80` it won't work since the `pasta` driver listens to `0.0.0.0:<port>` on the host system. It listen to all addresses so it doesn't require NAT / packet translation. Basically that request would go from `127.1.2.3:8080` in the host then `127.1.2.3:80` in the container.

If you have a burning desire to do IP forwarding, you can switch to docker's default `slirp4netns` by removing envars in `systemctl edit docker --user`. Please consult to [Official docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/#network-is-slow) for more information
