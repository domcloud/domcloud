# Deploy Bun Apps

[Bun](https://bun.sh) installation is powered by [webi](https://webinstall.dev/bun/). To install latest version with [deployment script](./deploy.mdx):

```yaml
features:
- bun
```

Without this, `bun` won't be available since no globally installed Bun runtime available.

Install other version using `bun latest`, `bun beta`, `bun 1.1.0`, etc. To uninstall use `bun off`.  Check the current version using `bun --version` from SSH.

## Example

The deployment script below installs the latest `bun` compiler and writes `app.ts` and serves that through [proxfix](./nginx.mdx#proxfix-nohup).

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/bun.yml"
source: clear
features:
  - bun latest
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT proxfix bun app.ts
commands:
  - filename: app.ts
    content: |
      const html_text = `
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
      <head>
          <title>Bun App</title>
          <link rel="stylesheet" href="//unpkg.com/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">
      </head>
      <body class="p-5 text-center">
          <p><img src="//images.unsplash.com/photo-1465153690352-10c1b29577f8?fit=crop&w=200&h=200" 
                  class="img-fluid rounded-circle"></p>
          <h1 class="mb-3">Hello, world!</h1>
          <p>Serving from Bun version ${Bun.version}</p>
          <p class="text-muted">DOM Cloud</p>
      </body>
      </html>
      `
      const server = Bun.serve({
        fetch(request) {
            return new Response(html_text, {
              headers: { "Content-Type": "text/html" },
            });
        },
      });
```

Note three things:
- `Bun.serve` already set the `port` arg from `PORT` env by default
- `proxfix bun app.ts` is used to run Bun with [a workaround of an ongoing issue](https://github.com/domcloud/proxy-fix)
- This proxfix proxies request to the bun app, this proxy support HTTP and Websocket 

For existing bun apps, use this deployment script. Please adjust relevant fields such as the startup file (change `app.ts`) and how `$PORT` is delivered (via `env PORT=$PORT proxfix bun ...`).

```yaml title="https://github.com/domcloud/recipes/blob/master/bun-gls.yml"
features:
  - bun latest
nginx:
  root: public_html/public
  passenger:
    enabled: "on"
    app_start_command: env PORT=$PORT proxfix bun app.ts
```

## App Management

Your app do not restarted automatically after file changes. To restart, run `restart` via SSH.

Environment variables can be set either using NGINX's `env_var_list` or `~/.bashrc`. Usually your language framework also reads `.env` files.

See [NGINX and App Daemon](./nginx.mdx) for more information about NGINX and App managements including restarting, environment variables, and other global limitations.

## App Logging

You can see app log from Check -> Check Process Logs tab. Only startup problems displayed in the browser.

Bun can show runtime errors in browser by setting `app_env: development` in the `passenger` config of NGINX.

It's recommended to use a proper logging mechanism such as [Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) or [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) then write it to a log file, or any other solution that suits you.

NGINX errors and traffic logs can be examined via Webmin or Check -> Check Process Logs tab.
